Acknowledging and Citing Marvin
-------------------------------



In Publications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use Marvin for work/research presented in a publication (whether directly, or as a dependency to another package), we ask that you cite the Marvin Paper (ADS - BibTeX). We provide the following as a standard acknowledgment you can use if there is not a specific place to cite the DOI:

    *This research made use of Marvin, a core Python package and web framework for MaNGA data, developed by Brian Cherinka,
    José Sánchez-Gallego, and Brett Andrews. (MaNGA Collaboration, 2016).*

If you wish, you can also include a link to https://api.sdss.org/doc/manga/marvin/refactor in addition to the above text.

In Presentations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

pip install sdss-marvin

In Projects
^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using Marvin as part of a code project (e.g., affiliated packages), a useful way to acknowledge your use of Marvin is with a badge in your README. We suggest this badge:
