In Publications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use Marvin for work/research presented in a publication (whether directly, or as a dependency to another package), we ask that you cite the `Marvin Software <https://zenodo.org/record/166010>`_. We provide the following as a standard acknowledgment you can use if there is not a specific place to cite the DOI:

    *This research made use of Marvin, a core Python package and web framework for MaNGA data, developed by Brian Cherinka,
    José Sánchez-Gallego, and Brett Andrews. (MaNGA Collaboration, 2016).*

Marvin's Bibtex entry to use::

    @misc{brian_cherinka_2016_166110,
      author       = {Brian Cherinka and
                      José Sánchez-Gallego and
                      Brett Andrews},
      title        = {sdss/marvin: Marvin Beta},
      month        = nov,
      year         = 2016,
      doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.166110},
