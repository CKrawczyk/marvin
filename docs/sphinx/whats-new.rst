What's New in Marvin 2.0 (June 2016)
====================================

Marvin 2.0 is a complete overhaul of Marvin 1.0, converting Marvin into a full suite of interaction tools.

Marvin 2.0 introduces two new modes of operations, :doc:`tools` and :doc:`api`, to the Marvin
environment, and introduces an extensive redesign of the `Marvin web app
<https://sas.sdss.org/marvin/>`_.

The major improvements and additions in this release:

* :doc:`../data-access-modes`: a new mode based navigation system that allows you to seamlessly interact with MaNGA data no matter where it is.

* :doc:`../tools`: a python package for accessing and interacting with MaNGA
  data, whether the files are in your computer or they need to be retrieved remotely via the
  API.

* :doc:`../api`: remotely grab the data you are looking for as JSONs to integrate directly into your local scripts

* :doc:`../query`: a tool to harness the full statistical power of the MaNGA
  data set by querying the :ref:`marvin-databases`.

* A completely overhauled :doc:`../web` interface, including:

  * A more powerful :ref:`web-search` with an intuitive pseudo-natural language
    search capability.

  * A simple and clean Plate and Galaxy detail page.

  * Interactive spectrum selection from the galaxy image.

  * An image roulette if you are feeling lucky.
