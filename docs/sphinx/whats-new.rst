What's New in Marvin 2.0
========================

Overview
--------

Marvin 2.0 expands the Marvin environment to include two new products,
:doc:`tools` and :doc:`api`, and implements an extensive redesign of the `Marvin
web app <https://sas.sdss.org/marvin/>`_ (now called :doc:`../web`). 

* :doc:`../tools`: a python package for accessing and interacting
  with MaNGA data, whether it is stored on your computer (:ref:`local-mode`)
  or needs to be retrieved remotely via the :doc:`api` (:ref:`remote-mode`).

* :doc:`../api`: these are the data you are looking for.

* :doc:`../web`: completely overhauled 

* :doc:`../queries`: a tool to harness the full statistical power of the MaNGA
  data set by querying the MaNGA database.

* :ref:`web-search`: an intuitive yet powerful pseudo-natural language search
  capability.

* :ref:`web-spectra`: plus interactive
